We have three microservices. So we can have 3 dev teams, working on each microservice.
Dev team size could be 5 which will include 2 junior developers, 2 senior/mid level developer and 1 technical lead.
All these 3 teams would report to 1 Engineering Manager.

Apart from dev team, there could be 1-2 QA and 1 Product Owner. Scrum can be derived by the Engineering manager.

# Agile Methodology
1. We can use scrum. Sprint size could be 2 weeks.
2. We can use Atlassian JIRA to monitor stories/tasks/defects and for story pointing, estimating the timelines, labelling the stories, while mentioning the criticality of each task.
3. We can use scrum poker to decide story point for each task/story.
4. Before the start of sprint, we can have Sprint grooming meeting to discuss the stories that need to be catered in the next sprint.
5. On the Sprint start day, 1-2 hour Sprint planning, where Dev and QA teams can do the story estimates.
6. Daily stand-up meeting on MSteams/Zoom/GoogleMeet to discuss the progress of the stories and tasks assigned to each individual.
7. Sprint retrospective on the last day of Sprint to discuss what could have been done better, what we shouldn't do and what should we do more often.
